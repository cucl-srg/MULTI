attributes in tcptrace.char are slightly different than original specifically those related to RTT
full sz characteristics of tcp trace. Also attributes pertaining to FFT are slightly off due to not
being able to find code for npu_padding

----------------code in script ./dft/sc2 -------------------

what it is at the moment --->| sed 's/ .*$/ 1/'| dft/fft/f -m -o 32 | 
what it should be -----> | sed 's/ .*$/ 1/'| npu_padding 0.001 | dft/fft/f -m -o 32 |


-----------------------perl modules------------------------

need to search in specific paths to find the necessary modules for the perl script to run, this can
be done by copying and pasting the following line of code in to the terminal or just adding it to
./.bashrc:


export PERL5LIB=/path/to/scripts/perl:/path/to/scripts/perl/lib/
